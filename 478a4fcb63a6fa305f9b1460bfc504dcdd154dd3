We support android versions for 3 years?  Though it would be good to know if it is being deleted.",

It would make sense to continue to fuzz it since the majority of our customers will not be on S for a few years.  \n\nWe would still require bug fixes in pppd even if it is removed from S (provided they where High+) so it would be useful to get the crashes internally rather than relying on external researchers.",
